# 2.1 Psychoenergetics: Perceptual and Perturbation Processes

Psychoenergetic phenomena are a class of direct interactions between human consciousness and the physical environment that can be observed and recorded.

## I. Perceptual Processes (Information Input)

These are processes where information is acquired without relying on the physical senses.

| Process | Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Spatial / Remote Viewing** | Viewing a distant military site (Clairvoyance). |
| **Animate** | "Pickup" of the thoughts of another (Telepathy). |
| **Temporal** | Direct foreknowledge of a future event (Precognition). |

## II. Perturbation Processes (Action Output)

These are processes where physical effects are produced without any obvious mechanism.

| Process | Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Inanimate** | Physical movement of an object by mental will (Psychokinesis). |
| **Directed** | Perturbation of an electronic component (microchip, gyro) by mental effort. |
| **Fundamental** | Perturbation of a basic physical process (e.g., radioactive decay). |

**Application:**
The application of perceptual processes in data collection is considered **verified**. The use of perturbation processes to influence weapons systems is considered **potential**.
