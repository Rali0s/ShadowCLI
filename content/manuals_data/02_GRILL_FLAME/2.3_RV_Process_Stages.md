# 2.3 Remote Viewing Process and Stages

## The RV Process

A Remote Viewing (RV) session is conducted by a "remote viewer" and an "interviewer" in a specially-designed room:
- **Room:** Acoustic-tiled, featureless, homogeneously-colored, and light-controlled to minimize environmental distractions.
- **Targeting:** The interviewer provides coordinates or other targeting information.
- **Blindness:** The interviewer is typically kept blind to the site to prevent inadvertent cueing.
- **Response:** The viewer provides **quick-reaction responses** (verbally, notes, and sketches).
- **Control:** **No use of drugs or technology** is employed to produce an altered state of consciousness.

## Six Stages in RV

Data in an RV session tend to develop in a natural pattern, moving from the general to the particular, progressing through six stages:

| Stage | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Major gestalt | "Land surrounded by water, an island" |
| **2** | Sensory contact | "Cold sensation, wind-swept feeling" |
| **3** | Dimension, motion, mobility | "Rising up, a panoramic view" |
| **4** | Quantitative aspects | "Three large buildings, clustered together" |
| **5** | Special qualitative aspects | "Scientific research, live organisms" |
| **6** | Significant analytical aspects | "BW preparation site" |

**Note:** The most-accomplished viewer was assessed as having developed to the point of Stage IV processes.
