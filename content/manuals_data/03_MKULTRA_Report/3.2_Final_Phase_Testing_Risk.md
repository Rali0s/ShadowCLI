# 3.2 MKULTRA: Final Phase Testing and Risk Assessment

## Advanced Testing of MKULTRA Materials

TSD doctrine holds that testing under accepted scientific procedures **fails** to disclose the full pattern of reactions that may occur operationally.

- **Covert Testing:** TSD initiated a program for covert testing of materials on **unwitting U. S. citizens** in 1955.
- **Modus Operandi:** Testing was conducted through an informal arrangement with cleared individuals in the **Bureau of Narcotics.**
- **Subjects:** Test subjects were sought and cultivated within the narcotics control setting, sometimes including informers or members of suspect criminal elements.

## Identified Risks

The covert testing phase is the most sensitive aspect of MKULTRA.

> "A significant limitation on the effectiveness of such testing is the infeasibility of performing scientific observation of results. The Bureau agents are not qualified scientific observers."

- In a number of instances, the test subject has become ill for hours or days, including **hospitalization in at least one case.**
- The risk of **serious damage to the Agency** in the event of compromise of the true nature of this activity is critical.

**Recommendation:** The Inspector General recommended **termination** of this phase of the MKULTRA program (covert testing on unwitting U.S. citizens).
