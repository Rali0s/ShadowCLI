# 3.0 MKULTRA Report: Executive Summary (1963)

## Memorandum to the DCI (Excerpt)

The MKULTRA activity is concerned with the research and development of **chemical, biological, and radiological materials** capable of employment in clandestine operations to **control human behavior.**

- MKULTRA was authorized by Allen W. Dulles in 1953.
- Normal procedures for project approval, funding, and accounting were waived.
- The program ranges from search for materials through analysis to progressive testing on animals and human beings.
- The concepts involved are found by many to be **distasteful and unethical.**

## Principal Conclusions and Recommendations

The inspection concluded that the program structure and controls need strengthening.

**Key Findings:**
1.  Structure and operational controls need strengthening.
2.  Improvements are needed in the administration of research projects.
3.  Some of the testing of substances under simulated operational conditions was judged to involve **excessive risk to the Agency.**

**Recommendation:** The DCI should approve a revised charter, explicitly requiring:
- Written approval for changes in scope.
- Maintenance of **exacting internal controls and records** of all substantive and support matters.
- **Testing only in accredited research institutions** under accepted scientific procedures.
