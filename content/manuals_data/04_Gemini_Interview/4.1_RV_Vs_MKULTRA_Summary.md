# 4.1 Comparative Summary: Remote Viewing vs. MKULTRA

This table summarizes the core operational, ethical, and scientific differences between the Remote Viewing (RV) programs (GRILL FLAME/SUN STREAK) and the MKULTRA chemical testing program.

| Aspect | RV Method (SUN STREAK/GRILL FLAME) | MKULTRA "Final Phase" Testing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Goal** | Isolate and capture "signal" of perception. | Control human behavior via chemical agents. |
| **Subjects** | Witting volunteers ("trainees," "personnel"). | "Unwitting U.S. citizens." |
| **Primary Tool** | Mental perception and psychic ability. | Chemical, biological, and radiological materials. |
| **Protocol** | "Double-blind" (Class A) controlled experiment. | Uncontrolled application ("agents are not qualified"). |
| **Scientific Control** | Rigorous, triple-blind method to isolate variables. | Lack of records, testing without scientific observation. |
| **Oversight** | Conducted under strict "Human Use" guidelines. | Conducted with "No records of the planning and approval." |
| **Identified Risk** | Misinterpreting fragmentary data. | **"Excessive risk to the Agency,"** serious damage, hospitalization. |

## The Core Scientific Difference

The RV programs adopted a highly structured, **"triple-blind" scientific methodology** to isolate the variable of remote viewing from cueing or telepathy.

In contrast, the MKULTRA "final phase" tested its product by **covertly dosing people**, operating outside of scientific and ethical controls.
