# 1.0 Project SUN STREAK Overview and Objectives

**GENERAL**
This manual describes procedures and activities of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Special Access Program (SAP) SUN STREAK. The mission is to develop an operational psychoenergetics capability (i.e. remote viewing) for the U.S. Intelligence Community.

The project is conducted within approved "human use" guidelines and does not involve any practices which expose participants to harmful circumstances or substances such as drugs.

**OBJECTIVES**
The main objective is to document psychoenergetic training and applications procedures to maintain reasonable uniformity and consistency in present and future SUN STREAK training and operations.

**APPLICATIONS**
SUN STREAK applications include, but are not limited to:
- Targeting of key enemy personnel (covert agents to military commanders).
- Monitoring hostile military movements, communications, and specific technologies.
- Detecting changes in the state of military units.
- Detecting and assessing hostile intelligence efforts and technological capabilities.

Because U.S. assets are subject to similar hostile threats, SUN STREAK can also assist in devising countermeasures to eliminate vulnerabilities.
