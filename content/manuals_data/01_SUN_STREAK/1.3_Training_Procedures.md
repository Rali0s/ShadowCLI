# 1.3 SUN STREAK Training Procedures

A number of methodologies are utilized to provide a framework for the standardizing of psychoenergetic learning.

## A. Orientation Testing/Training

**Duration:** One to six months.
**Purpose:** To provide new personnel with an introduction to training and applications procedures.

### Training Session Dynamics
- The trainee is instructed to state only **raw perceptions**.
- Experience has shown that specific definitions are quite often wrong while initial raw perception tends to be correct.
- The training room is highly controlled to minimize distractions: homogeneously-colored, acoustic-tiled, and featureless.
- Trainee and monitor function as a team.
- Training sessions are generally limited to **30 minutes** to prevent perceptual confusion.

## B. Coordinate Remote Viewing (CRV) Training

**Duration:** 12 to 18 months.
**Procedure:** External CRV training was a contracted service provided by SRI-I, involving lectures, practical exercises, and drills.

### Six Stages of CRV
The training procedures are broken down into stages that represent increasing perception:

1.  **Stages 1-3:** General site features, increasingly refined.
2.  **Stage 4:** Perception of specific site elements.
3.  **Stage 5:** Allows the trainee to "interrogate" his perceptions for clarification.
4.  **Stage 6:** Permits construction of 3-dimensional models of major site characteristics.

### Session Dynamics - Monitor Role
- The monitor provides the target information (specific site coordinates).
- The monitor repeats the targeting information and provides necessary feedback to reinforce contact.
- **Quick reaction-response** procedure is used to minimize imaginative embellishment.
