### 1\. (https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) GENERAL:

[cite\_start]This manual describes procedures and activities of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Special Access Program (SAP) SUN STREAK. [cite: 24] [cite\_start]The mission of SUN STREAK is to develop an operational psychoenergetics capability (i.e. remote viewing) for the U.S. Intelligecne Community. [cite: 25] [cite\_start]SUN STREAK is conducted within approved "human use" guidelines and does not involve any practices which expose participants to harmful circumstances or substances such as drugs. [cite: 26, 31]

### 2\. (https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) DEFINITIONS:

  * **a. (U) [cite\_start]Psychoenergetics:** A mental process by which an individual perceives, communicates with, and/or perturbs characteristics of a designated target, person, or event remote in space and/or time from that individual. [cite: 32, 33] [cite\_start]It does not involve any electronic devices located or focused at the target, nor does it involve classical photo interpretation of photographs obtained from overhead or oblique means. [cite: 34]
  * **b. (U) [cite\_start]Psychoenergetic Source:** A person who perceives, communicates with, and/or perturbs characteristics of a designated target, person, or event. [cite: 35]
  * **c. (U) [cite\_start]Psychoenergetic Trainee:** A person being trained to be a psychoenergetic source. [cite: 36]
  * **d. (U) [cite\_start]Psychoenergetic Session:** A single attempt by a psychoenergetic source and an interviewer/monitor to perceive, communicate with, and/or perturb characteristics of a designated target, person, or event. [cite: 37]
  * **e. (U) [cite\_start]Interviewer/Monitor:** The individual who interacts directly with the psychoenergetic source before, during, and after the session. [cite: 38]
  * **f. (U) [cite\_start]Remote Viewing:** The name of a method of psychoenergetic perception. [cite: 46] [cite\_start]A term coined by SRI-International (SRI-I) and defined as "the acquisition and description, by mental means, of information blocked from ordinary perception by distance, shielding, or time." [cite: 47]
  * **g. (U) [cite\_start]Coordinate Remote Viewing (CRV):** A Remote Viewing technique that requires the use of coordinates as targeting information. [cite: 48]
  * **h. (U) [cite\_start]Targeting Information:** An abstract referent which represents the target of interest. [cite: 49]
  * **i. (U) [cite\_start]Target/Site:** A specific area, person or event at a specific time. [cite: 50]
  * **j. (U) [cite\_start]Discrete State:** A type of psychoenergetic activity in which the source perceives his consciousness to be located at the target. [cite: 51]

### 3\. (https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) OBJECTIVE:

[cite\_start]It is the objective of this manual to document psychoenergetic training and applications procedures so as to maintain reasonable uniformity and consistency in present and future SUN STREAK training and operations. [cite: 52]

### 4\. (https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) APPLICATIONS:

[cite\_start]SUN STREAK applications of psychoenergetics include but are not limited to: (1) targeting of key enemy personnel from covert agents to key military commanders, (2) monitoring hostile military movements, lines of communication, and specific technologies, (3) detecting changes in the state of military units, (4) detecting and assessing hostile intelligence efforts targeted against friendly units/missions, and (5) detecting and assessing hostile technological capabilities in specific locations. [cite: 53] [cite\_start]Since US Department of Defense personnel, command and control locations and systems, units, materiel, and operations are subject to a similar hostile intelligence service threat, SUN STREAK can assist in devising countermeasures to eliminate or reduce vulnerabilities. [cite: 54]

### 5\. (U) SELECTION OF PERSONNEL:

  * **a. (https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) [cite\_start]Current Selection Criteria:** After over a year of participation within the psychoenergetic project, original source personnel were tested by the INSCOM Staff Psychologist in an attempt to determine a suitable profile by which further participants could be identified. [cite: 57] [cite\_start]The specific tests administered were (see Appendix B for test descriptions): [cite: 58]

      * (1) [cite\_start]The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). [cite: 62, 63]
      * (2) [cite\_start]Gordon Personal Profile Inventory (GPI). [cite: 64]
      * (3) [cite\_start]Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation-Behavior (FIRO-B). [cite: 65]
      * (4) [cite\_start]California Psychological Inventory (CPI). [cite: 66, 68]
      * (5) [cite\_start]Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS). [cite: 69, 70]
      * (6) [cite\_start]Personal Orientation Inventory (POI). [cite: 71]

    [cite\_start]For the most part, the group presented itself as emotionally stable with no marked trends. [cite: 73] [cite\_start]There did appear to be an interesting similarity in defensive style, a tending toward artistic, aesthetic, and cultural interests, and an introversive style of emotional expression. [cite: 74] [cite\_start]From these test results the INSCOM Staff Psychologist constructed a test that may be used as an initial screening tool in the selection of new psychoenergetic participants. [cite: 75] [cite\_start]This new test is called the INSCOM Factor Questionnaire. [cite: 76] [cite\_start]This instrument is used to compare the personality profiles of prospective Project candidates with successful psycoenergetic operatives. [cite: 76] [cite\_start]A high score suggests that individuals have similar characteristics to operational psychoenergetic personnel and may be potential selectees for the project. [cite: 77] [cite\_start]A score of 20 or higher is considered to indicate significant similarity to successful psychoenergetic personnel. [cite: 78] [cite\_start]Individuals who score within the parameters specified by the INSCOM psychologist would then receive personal interviews with SUN STREAK Project personnel. [cite: 79] [cite\_start]From these interviews new project participants would be selected and trained. [cite: 80]

  * **b. (https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) [cite\_start]Projected Selection Criteria:** SRI-I has completed a contract to investigate and report on a particular aspect of psychoenergetics relating to operational management of personnel; [cite: 81] [cite\_start]that is, to determine if a personality testing technique can be created which, when applied to a general population, would delineate specific individuals who exhibit a higher degree of talent for psychoenergetic abilities. [cite: 82] [cite\_start]Though the results provided by SRI-I came far short of providing either a thorough list of dependable selection criteria or a reliable selection system, they did establish a valuable data base and a promising point of departure for a future project that should be able to provide exactly what is needed, [cite: 83]

  * **c. (https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) [cite\_start]Voluntary Consent:** As required under the regulations governing "Human Use" (see para 2., Appendix A), all personnel operate on a strictly voluntary basis, and may withdraw at any time without any form of prejudicial action or consideration directed against them. [cite: 85, 93] [cite\_start]Further, participants are informed of any known or potential risks that might be inherent in program participation. [cite: 94] [cite\_start]This is accomplished through the use of a verbal briefing from a knowledgeable SUN STREAK official, and the execution of a personalized Statement of Consent form outlining all pertinent information and considerations. [cite: 95] [cite\_start]The voluntary consent requirement pertains to individuals assigned to the SUN STREAK Project and contractors/consultants. [cite: 96] [cite\_start]A sample of the voluntary consent form is attached as Inclosure 5, Appendix A. [cite: 97]

### 6\. (https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) TRAINING PROCEDURES:

[cite\_start]To provide a framework for the standardizing of the task of psychoenergetic learning, a number of methodologies are being utilized and conducted within the SUN STREAK Project. [cite: 101] [cite\_start]These are as follows: [cite: 102]

  * **a. (https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) Orientation Testing/Training:**

      * (1) [cite\_start]**Purpose:** To provide new personnel with an introduction to training and applications procedures. [cite: 104, 105]
      * (2) [cite\_start]**Administered by:** SUN STREAK Project personnel and selected contractor and subcontractors. [cite: 106]
      * (3) [cite\_start]**Location:** Fort George G. Meade, Maryland and other designated locations. [cite: 107]
      * (4) [cite\_start]**Duration:** One to six months. [cite: 108, 109]
      * (5) [cite\_start]**Description of Procedures:** Orientation testing/training is developed from the practical application of state-of-the-art psychoenergetic technology drawn from academic institutions, scientific laboratories, and research establishments around the world. [cite: 111, 112] [cite\_start]It is an eclectic approach, using those methods which have applications potential. [cite: 113] [cite\_start]Orientation testing is designed to determine if new personnel have aptitudes which would be of operational value and could be developed through training. [cite: 114] [cite\_start]This orientation testing consists of a series of controlled exercises in psychoenergetic functioning. [cite: 115] [cite\_start]New personnel may be asked to attempt to perceive, communicate with, and/or perturb characteristics of a designated target, person, or event remote in space and/or time from that individual. [cite: 116] [cite\_start]Orientation training is composed of practical exercises in Remote Viewing, lectures, literature review, and observation of others. [cite: 117] [cite\_start]It includes the use of locally significant sites, as well as more remote geographical locations as targets. [cite: 118] [cite\_start]A target pool consists of a controlled group of sites or targets and their associated targeting information. [cite: 124] [cite\_start]Prior to the beginning of a training session, a target is randomly selected from this target pool. [cite: 125] [cite\_start]Information available concerning the target is kept from the trainee until after the session. [cite: 126]
      * (6) [cite\_start]**Training Session Preliminaries:** Before a first training session is scheduled, the person being trained is oriented fully to the procedure to be followed by the monitor. [cite: 127] [cite\_start]The trainee is instructed that he or she should state only raw perceptions, since experience has shown that specific definitions are quite often wrong while initial raw perception tends to be correct. [cite: 128, 130] [cite\_start]Personnel being trained are always encouraged to express their feelings and ideas for enhancing all aspects of the psychoenergetics collection process. [cite: 129]
      * (7) [cite\_start]**Training Session Dynamics:** During the 30-60 minutes prior to the agreed-upon time of a training session, the monitor offers some encouragement to the trainee in the same manner that a coach might give a pep talk to his team. [cite: 131] [cite\_start]During the 15 minutes immediately before the session the trainee and monitor are generally silent. [cite: 132] [cite\_start]Experience has shown (unpublished data) that this quiet time enhances the training process. [cite: 133] [cite\_start]The training room is homogeneously-colored, acoustic-tiled, and featureless, with light controlled by a dimmer, so that environmental distractions can be minimized. [cite: 134] [cite\_start]During the entire process the trainee and monitor function as a team. [cite: 135] [cite\_start]The monitor provides encouragement with words of reassurance that the task is, in fact, possible. [cite: 136] [cite\_start]At no time is the session conducted by the trainee in the absence of all other persons. [cite: 137] [cite\_start]If the trainee does not have any immediate sensory impressions, the monitor applies no pressure. [cite: 138] [cite\_start]Rather, the monitor reassures the trainee that there is no time limit for the training session. [cite: 139] [cite\_start]If it appears to the monitor that the impressions are in some way contradictory or inconsistent, the monitor may then attempt clarification by asking questions in order to verify what the trainee first describes. [cite: 140] [cite\_start]All sessions are tape-recorded, and pen and paper are available for the trainee to sketch his or her perceptions. [cite: 141] [cite\_start]Experience has shown that some trainees prefer to combine written and oral descriptions, while some prefer to work seguentially. [cite: 142] [cite\_start]The average training session for orientation is approximately 15 minutes of actual perception. [cite: 143] [cite\_start]Trainees generally are not permitted to go beyond 30 minutes as this leads to perceptual confusion and eventual loss of the training affect. [cite: 144]
      * (8) [cite\_start]**Post Session Dynamics:** After the training session is over, the trainee and monitor obtain specific information about the target, either in picture descriptive form for remote geographic sites, or--as in the case of local sites--by actually visiting the target site. [cite: 145, 149] [cite\_start]The trainee and monitor then discuss the session results. [cite: 150] [cite\_start]The purpose of this post-session activity is to provide the trainee with the satisfaction of knowing how well he or she did while mental perceptions of the targeted site are still fresh in mind. [cite: 150]

  * **b. (https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) CRV Training:**

      * (1) [cite\_start]**Purpose:** To provide trainees with the requisite skills necessary to perform certain psychoenergetic applications. [cite: 152]
      * (2) [cite\_start]**Administered by:** In-house, contractor and subcontractor personnel. [cite: 153, 154]
      * (3) **Location:** Ft. Meade, MD; [cite\_start]SRI-I Menlo Park, CA/New York, NY; and other mutually agreed locations as required. [cite: 155]
      * (4) [cite\_start]**Duration:** 12 to 18 months. [cite: 156, 157]
      * (5) [cite\_start]**Description of Procedure:** External CRV training was a contracted service provided by SRI-I. [cite: 158] [cite\_start]The training itself involves lectures on theory coupled with practical exercises and drills. [cite: 159] [cite\_start]Particularly effective instructional procedures include active participation wherein the trainee interacts with the curriculum materials by responding, practicing, and testing each step of the material to be mastered; [cite: 160] [cite\_start]information feedback, wherein the trainee finds out with minimal delay whether the response is correct; [cite: 161] [cite\_start]and individualized instruction, wherein the trainee moves ahead at his or her own rate. [cite: 162] [cite\_start]The training procedures have been broken down into several stages representing various elements of CRV phenomena. [cite: 163] [cite\_start]These stages both facilitate training and actually follow the predictable course of increasing perception which builds itself in specific increments and impact. [cite: 164] [cite\_start]Stages 1 through 3 appertain to general site features, which become increasingly refined as individual competency with Stage 3 techniques develops. [cite: 165] [cite\_start]Stage 4 involves perception of specific site elements, a good portion of which may not be available to any other intelligence techniques, save for actual penetration of the site. [cite: 166] [cite\_start]Stage 5 allows the trainee in a sense to reverse the procedure and "interrogate" his perceptions, allowing clarification of various specific or subtle features of the site. [cite: 167] [cite\_start]Stage 6 permits the construction of 3-dimensional models of major site characteristics, with increasing refinements in detail. [cite: 168] [cite\_start]Experience and theory extension indicates that additional increments exist beyond Stage 6. [cite: 169] [cite\_start]Research is underway to develop and define the parameters and potentials of these additional fields. [cite: 169]
      * (6) [cite\_start]**Session Dynamics:** In conducting a CRV session, a remote viewer or trainee and a monitor begin by seating themselves at the opposite ends of a table in a special remote viewing room equipped with paper and pens, a tape recorder, and an overhead TV camera which allows either recording for documentation, or monitoring by individuals outside the room. [cite: 176] [cite\_start]The room is homogeneously-colored, acoustic-tiled, and featureless, with light controlled by a dimmer, so that environmental distractions can be minimized. [cite: 177] [cite\_start]The session begins when the monitor provides targeting information, in the form of specific site coordinates, to the trainee. [cite: 178] [cite\_start]For training purposes the monitor is allowed to know enough about the site to enable him to determine when accurate versus inaccurate information is being provided. [cite: 179] [cite\_start]The session then proceeds with the monitor repeating the targeting information at appropriate intervals and providing necessary feedback. [cite: 180] [cite\_start]The feedback procedure was designed to reinforce the trainee's contact with the site but not to assist him by random cuing. [cite: 181] [cite\_start]The remote viewer generates verbal responses and sketches, until a coherent response to the overall task requirement emerges. [cite: 182] [cite\_start]The use of the quick reaction-response procedure has been found useful in minimizing imaginative embellishment. [cite: 183]
      * (7) [cite\_start]**Post Session Dynamics:** After the training session is over, the trainee and monitor obtain specific information about the target. [cite: 185] [cite\_start]As in the case of orientation training, this is presented in picture descriptive form for remote geographic sites, or in the case of local sites, may involve actually visiting the target site. [cite: 186] [cite\_start]The trainee and monitor then discuss the session results, again with the purpose of providing the trainee with the satisfaction of knowing how well he or she did while mental perceptions of the targeted site are still fresh. [cite: 187]

  * **c. (https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) Applications Training:**

      * (1) [cite\_start]**Purpose:** To enable advanced trainees to integrate and expand acquired skills for psychoenergetic applications. [cite: 188, 191]
      * (2) [cite\_start]**Administered by:** SUN STREAK Project personnel. [cite: 192, 193]
      * (3) [cite\_start]**Location:** Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. [cite: 194, 195]
      * (4) [cite\_start]**Duration:** Continuous. [cite: 196, 198]
      * (5) [cite\_start]**Description of Procedure:** Procedures for applications training are essentially identical as those previously presented except in the style of target presented. [cite: 199, 200] [cite\_start]Applications targets are actual targets of military interest, [cite: 201] [cite\_start]such as US facilities or USSR sites from which data are available or can eventually be obtained. [cite: 205] [cite\_start]Targets of this type provide a basis for judgements regarding accuracy, utility, calibration, and depth of detail for any given trainee in a real world environment. [cite: 206, 208]

### 7\. (https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) APPLICATIONS: CPERATIONS PROCEDURES

[cite\_start]SUN STREAK sources can be used to perform psychoenergetic applications in support of intelligence and counterintelligence requirements (see paragraph, above). [cite: 209] [cite\_start]The dynamics of applications sessions parallel those of training sessions. [cite: 210] [cite\_start]The sequence of events consists of the following: (1) tasking; [cite: 210] (2) [cite\_start]development of a collection plan; [cite: 211] (3) [cite\_start]conduct of psychoenergetic session(s); [cite: 216] (4) [cite\_start]reporting; [cite: 211] (5) [cite\_start]control and evaluation. [cite: 212, 216] [cite\_start]Applications sessions are always conducted under the management of SUN STREAK personnel. [cite: 212] [cite\_start]Sessions may be conducted at Fort Meade or other locations as deemed necessary. [cite: 213] [cite\_start]Psychoenergetic consultants/contractors may be employed when required to meet applications requirements. [cite: 214]

### 8\. (https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES:

  * a. [cite\_start]Sources and trainees may be monitored using appropriate non-intrusive biological monitoring equipment. [cite: 217]
  * b. [cite\_start]The maximum number of applications sessions for each source will not exceed ten per week. [cite: 218]
  * c. [cite\_start]The maximum number of training sessions for each source will not exceed 20 per week. [cite: 219, 220]
  * d. (U) [cite\_start]SUN STREAK procedures do not involve the use of drugs, substances, or circumstances harmful to participants. [cite: 221] [cite\_start]Facilities at Kimbrough Army Hospital, Fort Meade, MD, are available if required. [cite: 222]

### 9\. (https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) CONFIDENTIALITY:

[cite\_start]Individuals performing as psychoenergetic trainees, sources, and monitors under the SUN STREAK Project will not have their roles identified outside of their parent organization without their specific prior consent, and they will be referred to in project reports only by an alpha-numeric designator. [cite: 223] [cite\_start]Products of SUN STREAK such as tapes, drawings, transcripts, rosters, or other materials which might reveal the identity of the source will be coded to assure the protection of their identity. [cite: 224]

### 10\. (https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT:

[cite\_start]Psychoenergetic sessions will be conducted in an ordinary room at ambient temperature and humidity during the normal waking hours of the participants. [cite: 225] [cite\_start]The only limitations on these parameters will be for security from electronic eavesdropping and elimination of ordinary distractions, such as radio, office machinery, and outside noises. [cite: 226, 227]

## APPENDIX A

### Historical Overview

(https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) [cite\_start]Concept Approval: Commander, US Army Materiel Development and Readiness Command approved in principle the US Army Material Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) involvement in the GRILL FLAME (GF) project, which began in April 1978 (GF was the predecessor to the SUN STREAK Project). [cite: 236] [cite\_start]In May 1978, the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence (ACSI) accepted lead responsibility for GF applications. [cite: 237] [cite\_start]Effective 14 January 1981, by approval of the Under Secretary of the Army, INSCOM became the only operational GF element in the Army. [cite: 235, 238] [cite\_start]Program management for GF was transferred to Commander, INSCOM effective 11 February 1981. [cite: 239] [cite\_start]OACSI, DAMI-ISH remained the Army focal point for policy matters and interface at the national level. [cite: 239] [cite\_start]The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) maintained overall DOD responsibility. [cite: 240] [cite\_start]Also in 1981, a joint services GF Committee consisting of DIA, Air Force and Army was formed. [cite: 240] [cite\_start]Later the Air Force Chief of Staff directed that the Air Force withdraw from the committee and all psychoenergetic programs. [cite: 241] [cite\_start]A comprehensive program was designed to determine the operational parameters and usefulness of psychoenergetics and assess the threat these phenomena posed to national security. [cite: 242] [cite\_start]At that time DIA was R\&D oriented and INSCOM's portion of GF was applications oriented. [cite: 243]

[cite\_start]In the FY83 DoD budget review the Budget Subcommittee of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence curtailed all psychoenergetic activities funded by the Army in the National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP), but directed that DIA could complete the third year of their effort and that all future Army funding be budgeted outside the NFIP. [cite: 244] [cite\_start]INSCOM terminated formal involvement with GF at the end of FY 82; [cite: 245] [cite\_start]in the fall of 1982, in keeping with congressional desires, the Commanding General INSCOM provided funding from Security and Investigative Activities (S\&IA) monies, and continued its efforts under a provisional compartmented SAP nicknamed CENTER LANE (CL). [cite: 246] [cite\_start]On 1 September 1983, the Secretary of the Army approved continued Army participation in CL activities within INSCOM and with appropriate contractors in a cooperative effort with DIA. [cite: 247] [cite\_start]In July 1984, CG, INSCOM determined that the CL technology and intelligence collection methodology would have greater potential and could be better utilized at a higher echelon in DOD. [cite: 248] [cite\_start]Accordingly, CG INSCOM offered to transfer CENTER LANE'S assets and personnel to DIA. [cite: 249] [cite\_start]On 7 March 1985, a memorandum of agreement was concluded between DIA and INSCOM providing for the interim operational control of CL by DIA, and for the ultimate assimilation of CL assets and personnel into DIA's new SUN STREAK psychoenergetics program. [cite: 250] [cite\_start]CL personnel were transferred to DIA in FY 1986 to form the nucleus of the SUN STREAK effort. [cite: 251]

## APPENDIX B

### Human Use Issues

1.  [cite\_start](https://www.google.com/search?q=S/NOFORN) In February 1979, the Army General Counsel determined that GRILL FLAME (GF) activities involved testing on human subiects. [cite: 257] [cite\_start]In March 1979, The Surgeon General's Human Subjects Research Review Board reviewed the GF protocol and concluded that it represented technology transfer and validation of the technology transfer, rather than research or clinical investigation, and as such, GF activities did not require approval for human use. [cite: 258, 260] [cite\_start]However, the Board expressed concerns that future Army follow-on work might be classified as research, and as such, plans should be considered to establish credible human use review procedures to oversee GF FOIAB5 activities. [cite: 261] [cite\_start]In April 1980, the Under Secretary of the Army approved the continuation of GF activities. [cite: 262] [cite\_start]In October 1980, the DoD, DIA, and Army General Counsel jointly agreed that it would be prudent to obtain written approval from the Deputy Secretary of Defense to conduct GF activities. [cite: 263] [cite\_start]ACSI, DA concurrently initiated action to obtain Secretary of the Army approval to conduct GF activities. [cite: 264] [cite\_start]In September 1982, INSCOM GRILL FLAME activities ceased because of NFIP restrictions; [cite: 265] [cite\_start]INSCOM psychoenergetic activities were reinitiated in December 1982, under the INSCOM CENTER LANE Project (ICLP), an S\&IA activity. [cite: 266] [cite\_start]Secretary or Under Secretary approval for GRILL FLAME/ICLP activities has been granted on 14 January 1981, 1 February 1982 and 1 September 1983, which were generally valid for one year. [cite: 267] [cite\_start]With the pending transfer of ICLP resources to DIA to become the new SUN STREAK Program, a DIA General Counsel decision in February 1985 designated SUN STREAK a "Human Use" program, determining that the Project involved "Experimentation on Human Subjects," and that relevant Human Use protocols did indeed apply to Project procedures and technologies. [cite: 268] [cite\_start]Conduct of the Project under Human Use regulations was subsequently approved on 13 March 1985 by the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense. [cite: 269]

2.  (U) Regulations governing "Experimentation on Human Subjects" are as follows:

      * a. (U) [cite\_start]45 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46, "Protection of Human Subjects" (Incl 1). [cite: 271]
      * b. (U) [cite\_start]Procedure 13, DOD Directive 5240.1-R (Incl 2). [cite: 272, 273]

## APPENDIX C

### Psychological Test Descriptions

1.  [cite\_start]**The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI):** Developed by S. R. Hathaway, Ph.D., and J. C. McKinley, M.D., The Psychological Corporation. [cite: 279] [cite\_start]The MMPI is designed to provide an objective assessment of some of the major personality characteristics that affect personal and social adjustment. [cite: 280] [cite\_start]The point of view determining the importance of a trait in this case is that of the clinical or personnel worker who wishes to assay those traits that are commonly characteristic of disabling psychological abnormality. [cite: 281] [cite\_start]The carefully constructed and cross-validated scales provide a means for measuring the personality status of literate adolescents and adults together with a basis for evaluating the acceptability and dependability of each test record. [cite: 282] [cite\_start]Nine scales were originally developed for clinical use of the inventory and were named for the abnormal conditions on which their construction was based. [cite: 283] [cite\_start]The scales were not expected to measure pure traits nor to represent discrete etiological or prognostic entities. [cite: 284] [cite\_start]Since they have been shown to have meaning within the normal range of behavior, these scales are now commonly referred to by their abbreviations--Hs (hypochondriasis), D (depression), Hy (Hysteria), Pd (psychopathic deviate), Mf (masculinity- femininity), Pa (paranoia), Pt (psychasthenia), Sc (schizophrenia), and Ma (hypomania)--or by their code numbers to avoid possibly misleading connotations. [cite: 285, 289] [cite\_start]Many other scales have subsequently been developed from the same items; [cite: 286] [cite\_start]Si (social introversion) is one that is commonly scored. [cite: 287, 290] [cite\_start]There are also three validating scales: L (lie), F (validity), and K (correction). [cite: 288, 290]
2.  [cite\_start]**Gordon Personal Profile Inventory (GPI):** Developed by Leonard V. Gordon, Ph.D., The Psychological Corporation. [cite: 291] [cite\_start]The GPI is companion instrument to the Gordon Personal Profile (GPP). [cite: 292] [cite\_start]It measures four additional traits, namely Cautiousness (C), Original Thinking (0), Personal Relations (P), and Vigor (V). [cite: 293] [cite\_start]The two instruments used together provide an economical coverage of eight important factors in the personality domain. [cite: 294] [cite\_start]Both have been found to be appropriate for use with high school, college, industrial, and general adult groups. [cite: 295]
3.  [cite\_start]**Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation Behavior (FIRO B):** Developed by Will Schutz, Ph.D., Consulting Psychologists Press, Inc. [cite: 297, 298] The fundamental interpersonal dimensions of the FIRO Theory are; [cite\_start]Inclusion (I), Control (C), and Affection (A) and are defined behaviorally as follows: [cite: 299, 300]
      * [cite\_start]**I** The interpersonal need for inclusion is the need to establish and maintain a satisfactory relationship with people with respect to interaction and association (both positive or negative). [cite: 301, 306]
      * [cite\_start]**C** The interpersonal need for control is the need to establish and maintain a satisfactory relationship with people with respect to control and power. [cite: 305, 307]
      * [cite\_start]**A** The interpersonal need for affection is the need to establish and maintain a satisfactory relationship with others with respect to love and affection. [cite: 308]
4.  [cite\_start]**California Psychological Inventory (CPI):** Developed by Harrison G. Gough, Ph.D., Consulting Psychologists Press, Inc. [cite: 309] [cite\_start]The CPI is intended primarily for use with "normal" (non-psychiatrically disturbed) subjects. [cite: 309] [cite\_start]Its scales are addressed to personality characteristics important for social living and social interaction, i.e., to variables that are woven into the fabric of everyday life. [cite: 310] [cite\_start]"Folk concepts" such as these are hypothesized to be relevant to the prediction and understanding of interpersonal behavior in any setting, culture, or circumstance. [cite: 311] [cite\_start]Thus, although the inventory has been found to have special utility in work with particular kinds of problems, e.g., delinquent and asocial behavior, it can also provide information of value in regard to educational, vocational, familial, and many other issues. [cite: 312]
5.  [cite\_start]**Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS):** Developed by Allen L. Edwards, Ph.D., University of Washington. [cite: 313, 314] [cite\_start]The EPPS was designed primarily as an instrument for research and counseling purposes, to provide quick and convenient measures of a number of relatively independent normal personality variables. [cite: 315] [cite\_start]The statements in the EPPS and the variables that these statements purport to measure have their origin in a list of manifest needs presented by H. A. Murray and other noted psychologists. [cite: 316] [cite\_start]The names that have been assigned to the variables are those used by Murray. [cite: 317] [cite\_start]These 15 measurable personality variables are; achievement (ach), deference (def), order (ord), exhibition (exh), autonomy (aut), affiliation (aff), intraception (int), succorance (suc), dominance (dom), abasement (aba), nurturance (nur), change (chg), endurance (end), heterosexuality (het), and aggression (agg). [cite: 318] [cite\_start]In addition to the above 15 personality variables, the EPPS provides a measure of test consistency and a measure of profile stability. [cite: 319]
6.  [cite\_start]**Personal Orientation Inventory (POI):** Developed by Everett L. Shostrom, Ph.D., Educational and Industrial Testing Service, San Diego, California. [cite: 320, 321] [cite\_start]The profile on the POI shows the degree to which the subject's attitudes and values compare with those of self-actualizing people. [cite: 322] [cite\_start]A self-actualizing person is one who is more fully functioning and who lives a more enriched life than does the average person. [cite: 323] [cite\_start]Such a person is developing and utilizing his unique talents to the fullest extent. [cite: 324]

### EVALUATION PROCEDURES

1.  **(S/NF/SS-2) Operational Phase:**
    (S/NF/SS-2) [cite\_start]The Program Manager will assess the value of the operational phase of the DRAGOON ABSORB/SUN STREAK program by requiring all data consumers (1.e., operational task originators) to furnish him with data accuracy and data utility assessments. [cite: 333] [cite\_start]Table 1 illustrates the general format and assessment scale (0-3) for this evaluation. [cite: 334] [cite\_start]Specific data categories may vary depending on the nature of the task or on specific objectives; [cite: 335] [cite\_start]however, the overall approach will remain the same. [cite: 336]
    (S/NF/SS-2) [cite\_start]The Program Manager will enter results of the accuracy and utility assessment into the project data base. [cite: 337] [cite\_start]He will make periodic reviews (quarterly) of this data to assess overall effectiveness. [cite: 338]
    (S/NF/SS-2) [cite\_start]The Program Manager, in coordination with the task originators and the Intelligence Community Task Coordinating Group, will develop an additional measure of program value. [cite: 339] [cite\_start]This measurement (overall program value) is designed to measure the net worth or total contribution of the task in relation to other tasks and to the overall intelligence mission. [cite: 340] [cite\_start]Data accuracy and utility may be high for a particular consumer, but the results may not have a significant overall impact. [cite: 341] [cite\_start]This "program value" scale is similar to the utility scale; however it is based on specific measures of over-all benefit. [cite: 342] [cite\_start]This value scale is as follows: [cite: 343]

    [cite\_start]**Program Value Scale** [cite: 347]

      * [cite\_start]**0** Little or no over-all program value [cite: 344, 348]
      * [cite\_start]**1** Some program value (1.e., helped refine estimates) [cite: 345, 349]
      * [cite\_start]**2** Moderate value (i.e., identified new data, narrowed down possibilities) [cite: 346, 350, 351]
      * [cite\_start]**3** High value (1.e., led to significant cost savings, identified critical high priority S\&T or operational activities) [cite: 352]
      * [cite\_start]**4** Exceptional value (1.e., predicted major events/activities, located lost/missing resources or personnel). [cite: 353, 354]

    [cite\_start]The value evaluation will be used in conjunction with other program evaluation parameters (accuracy, utility) for determining program accomplishments and for defining future program directions. [cite: 355]

2.  **(S/NF/SS-2) Training and Operational Qualifying Phase:**
    (C) [cite\_start]There are two other aspects of this program that will require evaluation by the Program Manager or by his representative; [cite: 445] [cite\_start]the basic training phase and the operational qualifying (or operational training) phase. [cite: 446]
    (S/NF/SS-2) [cite\_start]The basic training phase consists of a large variety of easy-to-verify training tasks that are designed for various stages of proficiency. [cite: 447] [cite\_start]Overall evaluations will be based on the "accuracy scale" used for operational projects and on an additional quantitative procedure. [cite: 448] [cite\_start]The accuracy scale will permit assessment of an individual's progress through the six training stages. [cite: 449] [cite\_start]The quantitative procedure (1.e., concept/element analysis) will allow assessments of degree of accuracy and will provide the basis for determining what general classes of operational projects a viewer can best perform. [cite: 450]
    (S/NF/SS-2) [cite\_start]The operational qualifying phase follows satisfactory completion of the training phase. [cite: 451] [cite\_start]This phase consists of tasks that simulate operational projects but differ in that ground truth can be readily determined, and there are no operational consumers. [cite: 452] [cite\_start]The main purpose of this phase is to systematically quantify the operational readiness of each viewer for a wide variety of potential operational projects. [cite: 453] [cite\_start]Data from this phase will also help identify the best types of operational tasks for remote viewing (RV) applications. [cite: 454]
    (S/NF/SS-2) [cite\_start]Each RV source will perform several hundred operational qualifying tasks per year. [cite: 455] [cite\_start]These tasks will include representative examples from DIA's intelligence production codes and from other potential operational requirements. [cite: 456] [cite\_start]Evaluation will be performed by the Program Manager or his representative and will be based on the accuracy scale used for operational projects. [cite: 457] [cite\_start]In addition, accurate estimates of operational reliability and utility will be made using quantitative methods (1.e., concept/element analysis, pattern evaluation). [cite: 458] [cite\_start]These evaluation procedures will require extensive use of a dedicated data base management system for storing large amounts of information and for performing appropriate analyses. [cite: 459]
    (S/NF/SS-2) [cite\_start]It is anticipated that a limited operational capability will be achieved by early to mid 1987. [cite: 460] [cite\_start]Some operational projects will be initiated in FY 1986; [cite: 460] [cite\_start]however, the type of task accepted will depend on the nature of the proposed task and on capability levels of available RV sources. [cite: 461]

### TARGETS CLASSESS AND DEFINITIONS

#### TRAINING REPORT

1.  [cite\_start](https://www.google.com/search?q=S/SK/WNINTEL) There are three classes of Remote Viewing (RV) training used in that portion of the in-house training which was modeled after the SRI-I subcontractor program. [cite: 471] [cite\_start]These classes deal with feedback requirements during the RV session, control of interviewer patter, trainee skill development, and motivation. [cite: 472] [cite\_start]These three classes (A, B, and C) are discussed below.\* [cite: 473]
    [cite\_start]*\*NOTE: The use herein of the terms Class A, B, or C differs from the definition applied and published by SRI-I for Class A, B, or C Coordinate Remote Viewing (CRV).* [cite: 480, 483]

2.  [cite\_start]**(https://www.google.com/search?q=S/SK/WNINTEL) CLASS C:** The majority of the training sessions for novice trainees are Class C. [cite: 474] [cite\_start]During this phase, the source trainee must learn to differentiate between emerging target relevant perceptions and imaginative overlay. [cite: 474] [cite\_start]To assist the trainee in this learning, immediate feedback is provided during the session. [cite: 475] [cite\_start]The interviewer is provided with a feedback package which may contain a map, photographs, and/or a narrative description of the target. [cite: 476] [cite\_start]During Class C sessions the interviewer provides the trainee with immediate feedback for each element of data he provides, with the exception that negative feedback is not given. [cite: 477] [cite\_start]Should the trainee state an element of information that appears incorrect, the interviewer remains silent. [cite: 478] [cite\_start]Feedback, in order to prevent inadvertent cuing, (interviewer overlay), is in the form of very specific statements made by the interviewer. [cite: 479] [cite\_start]These statements and their definitions are as follows: [cite: 479]

      * [cite\_start]**Correct (C)** This indicates that the information is correct in context with the site location, but is not sufficient to end the session. [cite: 482]
      * [cite\_start]**Probably Correct (PC)** This statement means that the interviewer, having limited information about the target, though he cannot be absolutely sure, believes that the information provided is correct. [cite: 488]
      * [cite\_start]**Near (N)** This indicates that the information provided is not an element of the specific site, but is correct for the immediate surrounding area. [cite: 489]
      * [cite\_start]**Can't Feedback (CFB)** This statement indicates that, due to limited information about the target, the interviewer cannot make a judgment as to the correctness of the data. [cite: 490] [cite\_start]It means neither correct nor incorrect. [cite: 491]
      * [cite\_start]**Site (S)** This indicates the site has been correctly named for the specific stage being trained (manmade structure for Stage 1, bridge for Stage III, etc.). [cite: 492] [cite\_start]"Site" indicates that the session is completed. [cite: 493]

    [cite\_start]During the session the trainee writes the abbreviation (see above) of the feedback next to the data. [cite: 494] [cite\_start]This allows the trainee to review the correct elements and produce a summary which describes the site. [cite: 495] [cite\_start]The training session continues until the interviewer responds with the feedback of Site. [cite: 496]

3.  [cite\_start]**(https://www.google.com/search?q=S/SK/WNINTEL) CLASS B:** Once a trainee begins to demonstrate his ability to reliably distinguish imaginative overlay and report target relevant data elements, feedback is withdrawn. [cite: 497] [cite\_start]In Class B training sessions the interviewer knows what target he desires the trainee to describe but does not provide the trainee with any direct feedback during the course of the session. [cite: 498] [cite\_start]This process develops the trainee's ability to internalize his awareness of relevant (correct) versus extraneous (incorrect) cognitive structures (mental perceptions). [cite: 499] [cite\_start]During Class B sessions the interview may ask the trainee to elaborate on specific elements of data provided, thereby guiding the trainee to describe specific areas of the target. [cite: 500] [cite\_start]The interviewer is only permitted to ask the trainee to elaborate on specific elements already reported by the trainee. [cite: 501] [cite\_start]The interviewer may not introduce new elements into the session (cue the source) in an attempt to encourage the trainee to properly describe the site. [cite: 502] [cite\_start]Class B sessions are especially helpful in developing refined skills in the trainee. [cite: 503] [cite\_start]For example, when the interviewer knows that a particular target area within a site may be of interest (i.e., a specific room in a building), he can guide the trainee's attention to that area by asking the trainee to elaborate on specific elements of data which the interviewer knows to pertain to the area of interest. [cite: 504, 506] [cite\_start]With practice in Class B, the trainee soon learns to control his own perceptual faculties, a necessary step for further training and operational intelligence collection. [cite: 505]

4.  [cite\_start]**(https://www.google.com/search?q=S/SK/WNINTEL) CLASS A:** Class A training is similar to what the R\&D community refers to as a "double blind" experiment. [cite: 511, 519] [cite\_start]The purposes for Class A training and for R\&D double blind experiments differ however. [cite: 512] [cite\_start]The R\&D community uses double blind experimental protocols to test a variable under controlled conditions. [cite: 513] [cite\_start]Class A training is not a test for the trainee, but a process whereby the source learns to function with the interviewer in a team effort to acquire and describe information concerning a target of interest. [cite: 514] [cite\_start]In Class A, both the trainee and the interviewer are provided no information (double blind) concerning the site to be described during the session. [cite: 515] [cite\_start]Rather than trying to please the interviewer with his descriptions, the trainee is motivated to work with the interviewer in producing valid information about the site of interest. [cite: 516] [cite\_start]This motivational difference is critical in forcing the trainee to use his RV ability to acquire and describe site dependent information as opposed to interviewer dependent telepathic data (in an attempt to please the interviewer) or data RVed from the feedback package (in an attempt to receive external positive reinforcement from the interviewer, i.e., Correct, Probably Correct, and/or Site). [cite: 517] [cite\_start]Working as a team in a Class A session, the interviewer and source trainee combine their aptitudes (the interviewer with his directive, analytic skill and the trainee with his exploratory, perceptual ability) to report information of interest about the designated target. [cite: 518]

5.  [cite\_start](https://www.google.com/search?q=S/SK/WNINTEL) The three classes of RV training (A, B. and C) are interdependent. [cite: 520] [cite\_start]Each is designed to deal with separate learning requirements in the acquisition of RV skills. [cite: 521] [cite\_start]It must be remembered that the concept of classes herein applies to training. [cite: 522] [cite\_start]Operational application of RV requires its own unique, specifically designed feedback requirements and task dependent control of interviewer/source interaction. [cite: 522, 523] [cite\_start]Trainee sources also require operational training beyond the narrow confines of the SRI-I subcontractor modeled training program before they can be expected to produce dependable, timely intelligence information.
