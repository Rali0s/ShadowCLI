# ShadowFang Training Manual

## System Overview
- Frequency entrainment for rapid focus and recall.
- HUMINT-derived observation drills for situational awareness.
- Safety gates and tie-down procedures to maintain cognitive hygiene.

## Universal Protocol
1. **Preparation (5 min)** — Set environment, regulate breathing, choose base frequency.
2. **Induction (10 min)** — Anchor on sacred geometry visual, stabilize at 10 Hz.
3. **Training (20-30 min)** — Alternate task-specific beats, capture notes in logbook.
4. **Integration (10 min)** — Shift toward 6 Hz theta, summarise insights aloud.
5. **Exit (5 min)** — Return to beta range, perform grounding exercise.

## Safety Reminders
- Hydrate before and after sessions.
- Maintain a physical grounding object within reach.
- Pause immediately if disorientation or discomfort emerges.

## Practice Rotations
- Monday / Thursday — Memory consolidation + Alpha Flow State preset.
- Tuesday / Friday — RV target drills with theta induction.
- Weekend — Freeform experimentation with binaural differentials under 10 Hz.
