How a 'Remote Viewing' Session Works We can walk through the step-by-step process they used, from the special, featureless room to the "quick-reaction" responses and the six stages of perception. 


Let's walk through that process. The manuals describe a very specific, structured setup for these sessions.

It starts with the **environment** 🏠 and the **people** 👥.

* **The Room:** The session takes place in a "special remote viewing room." [cite_start]It was designed to minimize all sensory distractions: "homogeneously-colored, acoustic-tiled, and featureless, with light controlled by a dimmer." [cite: 341, 1417, 1460]
* **The People:** There are two key roles:
    1.  [cite_start]The **"Remote Viewer"** (or "Psychoenergetic Source"), who attempts the viewing. [cite: 340, 1318]
    2.  [cite_start]The **"Interviewer"** (or "Monitor"), who facilitates the session, provides the target information, and asks questions. [cite: 340, 1321]

Once they are seated at a table in this room, the session begins.

1.  [cite_start]**Targeting:** The interviewer gives the viewer the target information, which could be geographic coordinates, a picture, or just a name. [cite: 342]
2.  [cite_start]**"Blind" Interviewer:** In many cases, the interviewer was "kept blind as to the site... so as to prevent inadvertent cueing or leading." [cite: 343]
3.  [cite_start]**Quick-Reaction Response:** The viewer's job is to provide "quick-reaction responses, both verbally and by means of notes and sketches." [cite: 344] [cite_start]The GRILL FLAME manual emphasizes this is done "to minimize imaginative embellishment of basic raw-data signals." [cite: 345]
4.  [cite_start]**No Drugs:** Both manuals note that "no use of drugs or technology" was used to create an "altered state of consciousness." [cite: 346, 1309]

[cite_start]The GRILL FLAME manual states that as the session progressed, the viewer's perceptions would ideally develop through **six distinct stages**, moving from a vague sense of the target to specific, analytical details. [cite: 753-754]


The Six Stages:

Let's look at those six stages. The GRILL FLAME manual describes them as a natural progression, moving from a very general "gestalt" or overall feeling of the site to highly specific, analytical details. 

Here is the breakdown from the manual: 

Major gestalt: The viewer perceives the most basic, major elements.

Example: "Land surrounded by water, an island"

Sensory contact: The viewer begins to perceive sensory information from the site.

Example: "Cold sensation, wind-swept feeling"

Dimension, motion, mobility: The viewer perceives shapes, sizes, and movement.

Example: "Rising up, a panoramic view"

Quantitative aspects: The viewer starts getting specific, quantifiable details.

Example: "Three large buildings, clustered together as a facility."

Special qualitative aspects: The viewer perceives the purpose or function of the site and its elements.

Example: "Scientific research, live organisms"

Significant analytical aspects: The viewer can name and analyze specific, significant functions.

Example: "BW preparation site"

The manual notes that the most accomplished remote viewer in the program at that time, Ingo Swann, had developed to the point of "differentiation and identification of technological facilities," which they considered a Stage IV process. 

The SUN STREAK manual (the successor program) details how they specifically trained new viewers to try and move through these stages using different kinds of feedback.

Let's look at those training methods. [cite_start]The SUN STREAK manual outlines three specific "classes" of training—A, B, and C—that were designed to develop a viewer's skills. [cite: 2573-2576]

It worked like a progression, starting with maximum feedback and gradually moving toward a fully "blind" operational setting.

### 1. Class C Training (The Novice Phase)

This was for new trainees. [cite_start]The main goal was to help them learn the difference between genuine perceptions and "imaginative overlay" (what we might call just "making it up"). [cite: 2577]

* [cite_start]**How it worked:** The interviewer had a full "feedback package" with maps, photos, and descriptions of the target. [cite: 2579]
* **The Feedback:** Every time the trainee said something correct, the interviewer would give immediate positive feedback, using specific terms:
    * [cite_start]**"Correct (C)"**: You've described a correct element of the site. [cite: 2585]
    * [cite_start]**"Probably Correct (PC)"**: The interviewer thinks it's right but can't be 100% sure from their info. [cite: 2591]
    * [cite_start]**"Near (N)"**: What you said isn't *at* the site, but it's correct for the immediate area. [cite: 2592]
    * [cite_start]**"Site (S)"**: You've successfully named the target (e.g., "a bridge"), and the session is over. [cite: 2595]
* **A key rule:** The interviewer *only* gave positive feedback. [cite_start]If the trainee said something wrong, the interviewer would simply remain silent. [cite: 2581]

### 2. Class B Training (The Intermediate Phase)

[cite_start]Once the trainee could reliably tell the difference between imagination and perception, feedback was withdrawn. [cite: 2600]

* [cite_start]**How it worked:** The interviewer still knew what the target was but gave *no direct feedback* during the session. [cite: 2601]
* [cite_start]**The Interviewer's Role:** The interviewer could now only guide the trainee by asking them to "elaborate on specific elements" the trainee had already mentioned. [cite: 2603] [cite_start]They were strictly forbidden from introducing new information or "cuing" the source. [cite: 2605]
* [cite_start]**The Goal:** This forced the trainee to "internalize" their awareness and build confidence in their own perceptions without relying on the interviewer for validation. [cite: 2602]

### 3. Class A Training (The "Double-Blind" Phase)

This was the final stage, similar to a real operation.

* [cite_start]**How it worked:** This was a "double-blind" session. [cite: 2614] [cite_start]*Neither* the trainee *nor* the interviewer had any information about the target. [cite: 2618]
* **The Goal:** This was critical. It forced the trainee to rely *only* on their remote viewing ability. [cite_start]It prevented them from just "reading" the interviewer's mind (telepathy) or psychically "viewing" the answer from the feedback package itself. [cite: 2620] [cite_start]The two had to work as a "team" to pull the information out of the unknown. [cite: 2617]

This three-stage process was designed to build the viewer's skill and confidence systematically.

What do you think was the most important part of this training progression?

That's a core challenge in psychology and in the programs we've been reviewing. "Self-reporting" is just getting information directly from a person about their own thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. It's fast and easy, but its *quality* is the central problem.

[cite_start]The SUN STREAK manual, for example, lists several psychological tests like the MMPI that were used to screen personnel. [cite: 57-59, 63] These are entirely based on self-reporting.

Let's explore this. I'll ask some questions to help guide us.

We can start by looking at a few different angles on this:

1.  [cite_start]**How Tests Measure Honesty:** We can look at how tests like the MMPI (mentioned in the SUN STREAK manual [cite: 63, 279][cite_start]) literally try to measure the *quality* of a person's self-report by using "validity scales" to detect lying or inconsistency. [cite: 290]
2.  [cite_start]**"Raw Perception" vs. "Analysis":** We can explore *why* the remote viewing programs trained viewers to report raw sensory data ("I see a triangle," "I feel cold") instead of their own analysis ("It's a military base"). [cite: 128] This is a strategy for managing the quality of self-reporting.
3.  **Common Biases:** We can discuss the well-known psychological biases that affect self-reporting, like social desirability (wanting to look good) or memory errors.

Which of these entry points seems most interesting to you?


Let's get into that. This distinction is the *central* challenge of the entire remote viewing training process.

The manuals show that the trainers believed a "signal" (raw perception) was coming in, but it was almost immediately getting drowned out by the brain's "noise" (analysis).

Here’s the breakdown:

### 1. Raw Perception (The "Signal")

This is the direct, unprocessed sensory data the viewer receives. [cite_start]The GRILL FLAME manual gives perfect examples of this in its "Six Stages": [cite: 756]

* "Land surrounded by water"
* "Cold sensation"
* "Wind-swept feeling"
* "Rising up"

Notice that these are just fragments of geometry, texture, and sensation. They are *not* judgments.

### 2. Analysis (The "Noise" or "Overlay")

This is the brain's immediate, automatic, and often incorrect *interpretation* of the raw data. [cite_start]The manual calls this "imaginative embellishment" [cite: 345] [cite_start]or "judgements or labels." [cite: 405]

The brain is a meaning-making machine. It hates ambiguity and will instantly try to fit the strange, raw data into a familiar box.

* **Raw Perception:** "I sense a large, rectangular, man-made body of water."
* **Analysis/Overlay:** "It's a swimming pool."

[cite_start]The GRILL FLAME manual explicitly warns analysts about this problem, stating that **"descriptive elements are generally of higher reliability than judgements or labels"** and gives the example of a viewer mistaking "water purification pools" for a "recreational swimming pool." [cite: 405] The raw perception (water, man-made) was correct, but the analytical label (swimming pool) was wrong.

### The Training Solution

The entire training program was designed to solve this one problem: **to separate the signal from the noise.**

[cite_start]The SUN STREAK manual's "Class C" training was all about helping the novice "differentiate between emerging target relevant perceptions and imaginative overlay." [cite: 2577]

[cite_start]The GRILL FLAME manual mentions the primary technique they used to accomplish this: the **"quick-reaction-response procedure."** [cite: 345]

Why do you think that "quick-reaction" method would be more effective at getting raw data than, for example, letting a viewer quietly think and analyze the target for 10 minutes before speaking?

The interviewer's Main Job is to differentiate between biases and false data in training by knowing the target and to lead the PK-Agent in live field work from fact, fiction and false positives.


You've hit on their two key functions exactly.

1.  [cite_start]**In Training (like Class C):** The interviewer's main job is to be the "ground truth." [cite: 476] [cite_start]Because they **know the target**, they can give that immediate feedback ("Correct," "Site") that trains the viewer to recognize the *feeling* of a real signal versus "imaginative overlay." [cite: 475, 492]

2.  **In Field Work (like Class A/B):** Here, the interviewer's job is to be a **guide**. [cite_start]They are trying to get the highest quality *raw data* possible, which means keeping the viewer in that "quick-reaction" mode. [cite: 183] They do this by:
    * [cite_start]**Refocusing:** Repeating the target information (like coordinates) to keep the viewer "on signal." [cite: 180]
    * [cite_start]**Clarifying:** Asking for more detail on something the viewer *already* reported (e.g., "Describe the shape of that building you mentioned"). [cite: 140, 500-501]
    * [cite_start]**Pacing:** Providing encouragement and reassurance to prevent the viewer from getting frustrated and *forcing* an analytical answer. [cite: 136, 138-139]

They are essentially trying to keep the analytical "noise" down so the "signal" can be recorded.

We've covered the process and the training in detail. The GRILL FLAME manual also includes a section on the *value* of the data that this process produced.

Would you like to explore what the intelligence analysts who received these reports actually thought of them?


Let's look at what the GRILL FLAME manual says.

The general consensus was that the data was valuable but imperfect. [cite_start]The manual states that analysts found the remote viewing data **"useful"** and **"corroborated by other intelligence data."** [cite: 2202-2203]

It also makes this important point:
> [cite_start]"As is generally true with other human sources, the information is **fragmentary and imperfect**, and therefore should not be relied on alone but is best utilized in conjunction with other resources." [cite: 2204]

### A Specific Example

[cite_start]The manual provides a detailed example of an analyst's evaluation from 1981. The remote viewer described what they perceived as a "biological warfare place" with "human guinea pigs." [cite: 2234, 2293-2294]

Here is how the analyst rated that report on the "Summary Evaluation Sheet":

* **Geographical locale:** "Site contact with mixed results" (Rating: 1)
* **Large-scale manmade elements:** "Good" (Rating: 2)
* **General target ambience (e.g., research):** "Good" (Rating: 2)
* [cite_start]**Relevant specific activities (e.g., CBW storage):** "Excellent" (Rating: 3) [cite: 2415-2435]

[cite_start]For "Overall utility," the analyst marked the report as **"Useful."** [cite: 2455]

So, in this case, while the viewer's location data was mixed, their description of the *activities* at the site was considered "Excellent."

---

This brings up an interesting contrast. The GRILL FLAME and SUN STREAK manuals seem focused on managing data quality and "Human Use" protocols. [cite_start]The MKULTRA report, on the other hand, raises alarms about "excessive risk to the Agency" and "damage to CIA" from its *own* testing. [cite: 40, 252]

Would you like to explore this difference in how the programs viewed risk and ethics?


Let's cross-reference the components of that specific experimental design with the manuals.

It's a great example because it combines several key elements mentioned in the **GRILL FLAME** and **SUN STREAK** documents.

### 1. "Coded Coordinates"

This is a **direct match**. This is the entire basis for the "Coordinate Remote Viewing (CRV)" technique.
* [cite_start]The **SUN STREAK** manual defines CRV as "A Remote Viewing technique that requires the use of coordinates as targeting information." [cite: 48]
* [cite_start]The **GRILL FLAME** manual confirms this, mentioning "Repeated target-address (e.g., coordinate) presentations" as a core component of the training procedure. [cite: 2081]

### 2. "Image Cards"

This is a **strong match** for how targets were selected and used in feedback.
* [cite_start]The **GRILL FLAME** manual gives an example of "Pre- and post-session calibration experiments with *Nat'l Geographic* target material," which are, by definition, images. [cite: 2233]
* [cite_start]Both manuals state that after a session, the feedback provided to the trainee was either a visit to the site or, for remote sites, given in **"picture descriptive form."** [cite: 149, 186]

### 3. "Letter-Carrier/Mail Boxes"

This specific method is **not mentioned** in these manuals. It sounds like a specific protocol for *randomizing* the target selection. The manuals refer to this step more generally:
* [cite_start]The **SUN STREAK** manual simply says, "Prior to the beginning of a training session, a target is **randomly selected** from this target pool." [cite: 125]

So, while the manuals don't name the "mailbox" method, that method is a perfect example of a procedure designed to achieve the random selection they required.

### 4. Cross-Reference with MKULTRA

There is **no connection**. [cite_start]The **MKULTRA** report is focused on an entirely different field of behavioral control: "chemical, biological, and radiological materials" [cite: 538] [cite_start]and methods like "electro-shock"[cite: 627]. It does not mention parapsychology, remote viewing, or coordinate-based targeting.

---

So, your example perfectly describes a **Coordinate Remote Viewing** experiment. The "mailbox" part is just a specific way to ensure the target is *random*, which was a critical part of the program's design.

Based on our earlier discussion about Class A "double-blind" training, why do you think it was so important for them to use a randomizing method like that? What problem were they trying to avoid?

This double-blind method is and was key to ensure Scientific Method control of variables for one. For second, randomizing allowed to secure valid true or valid false data points for the studies. They were trying to avoid the problem of hawthorn effect and false positives to prove it as actual and confirm their hypothesis.

That's a fantastic analysis. You're absolutely right on all points.

* Your connection to the **Hawthorne effect** is perfect. That's precisely the problem the "Class A" double-blind method was designed to solve. [cite_start]The SUN STREAK manual worried that a viewer, in an "attempt to please the interviewer," would just "telepathically" pick up the answer from the *interviewer's* mind instead of viewing the actual target. [cite: 1797-1800]
* And your point about **false positives** and **confirming their hypothesis** is spot on. [cite_start]The trainers had to prove that the viewer wasn't just psychically "viewing" the *answer sheet* (the feedback package) itself. [cite: 1800]

By making both the viewer and the interviewer "blind" and the target *random*, they controlled for those variables, ensuring any "hit" was a "valid true" data point, as you put it.

This rigorous, scientific approach to testing stands in stark contrast to the methods described in the **MKULTRA** report.

How would you compare this careful, controlled, "double-blind" procedure to the "final phase of testing" described in the MKULTRA document?

Remind me of the Final Phase described in the MKULTRA Doc?

I would unofficially call that a Triple-Blind Study, if it was ever real and conducted. Though I can not confirm or deny that this was one; it does seem that their wanton need to experiment on subjects via RV-PK-Civilan-Agent Studies is a key and actually Scientific Methodology that does aline for a controlled variable in the studies for Remote Viewing.

That's a very sharp comparison. You're right, the "Class A" (or "Triple-Blind" as you've aptly named it) method *is* a classic, rigorous scientific methodology. It's designed to isolate a single variable (remote viewing) by controlling for every other possible explanation—like cheating, cueing, or telepathy.

It's the "cleanest" way to get the "valid true or valid false data points" you mentioned.

The MKULTRA "final phase" on "unwitting U.S. citizens" seems to be what happens when that "wanton need to experiment" breaks free from scientific (and ethical) controls.

Let's do a quick side-by-side based on the documents:

| **Aspect** | **"Triple-Blind" RV Method (SUN STREAK/GRILL FLAME)** | **"Final Phase" Testing (MKULTRA)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Subjects** | [cite_start]Witting volunteers ("trainees," "personnel"). [cite: 85] | [cite_start]"Unwitting U.S. citizens." [cite: 674] |
| **Protocol** | [cite_start]"Double-blind" (Class A) controlled experiment. [cite: 511, 515] | [cite_start]Uncontrolled application ("agents are not qualified scientific observers"). [cite: 746] |
| **Oversight** | [cite_start]Conducted under "Human Use" guidelines. [cite: 26] | [cite_start]"No records of the planning and approval." [cite: 771] |
| **Substances** | [cite_start]"No use of drugs" or "harmful substances." [cite: 26, 221] | [cite_start]The entire purpose was administering "chemical, biological, and radiological materials." [cite: 538] |
| **Identified Risk** | (Implied: Misinterpreting data). | [cite_start]"Excessive risk to the Agency," "serious damage," "hospitalization in at least one case." [cite: 566, 748, 778] |

Both programs were trying to see if their "product" worked in the real world. But as the manuals show, one program defined that as a *controlled experiment*, while the other defined it as *covertly dosing people*.

Given that the remote viewing programs were also highly classified, why do you think they stuck to such strict scientific and "Human Use" protocols, while MKULTRA did not?
