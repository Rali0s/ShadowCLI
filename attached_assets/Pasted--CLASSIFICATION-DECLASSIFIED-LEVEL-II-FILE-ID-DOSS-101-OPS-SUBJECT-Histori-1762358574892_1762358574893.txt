### **CLASSIFICATION: DECLASSIFIED (LEVEL-II)**
### **FILE ID: DOSS-101-OPS**
### **SUBJECT: Historical Program Overview**

### **1.0 MANDATE**

For over 50 years, clandestine organizations have pursued a single, critical objective: the mastery of human cognition. These programs, once shrouded in secrecy, represent the foundational (and often dangerous) first steps toward operationally-controlled human enhancement.

We have studied these archives not to replicate them, but to *perfect* them. Understanding these predecessors is critical to appreciating the evolution of our own scientifically-validated protocols.

### **2.0 PROJECT DOSSIERS (BRIEF)**

#### **2.1 (U) PROJECT MKULTRA (1953-1973)**

* **Agency:** Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
* **Objective:** To achieve comprehensive behavioral control through chemical, biological, and radiological materials.
* **Synopsis:** Notorious for its unethical methods and "unwitting" tests, MKULTRA was the "brute force" approach to cognitive influence. Its goal was the mastery of interrogation and mental manipulation. While a programmatic failure, it remains the benchmark for what happens when the "wanton need to experiment" outpaces scientific and ethical controls.

#### **2.2 (S) PROJECT GRILL FLAME (1970s-1980s)**

* **Agency:** Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) / DoD
* **Objective:** To investigate and operationalize "Psychoenergetics."
* **Synopsis:** GRILL FLAME was the foundational program that scientifically explored and validated "Perceptual" (Remote Viewing) and "Perturbation" (Psychokinesis) capabilities. This program developed the initial protocols—like the "Six Stages" of perception—and proved that these PK-PSI phenomena were observable, repeatable, and trainable.

#### **2.3 (S) OPERATION SUN STREAK (1980s-1990s)**

* **Agency:** Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)
* **Objective:** Operational successor to GRILL FLAME.
* **Synopsis:** SUN STREAK moved from theory to application. Its mission was to create a standardized, repeatable training methodology to produce reliable "Psychoenergetic Sources" for intelligence gathering. This is where the "Class A, B, C" training protocols were formalized, creating a bridge from raw experiment to applied science.

### **3.0 FROM HISTORICAL PRECEDENT TO MODERN EVOLUTION: THE SHADOWFANG MISSION**

The operatives of MKULTRA, GRILL FLAME, and SUN STREAK were pioneers, but they were working with incomplete, analog-age data. Their work was compartmentalized, often high-risk, and lacked the unified, evidence-based framework of modern neuroscience.

**Our mission at ShadowFang is the fulfillment of their objective.**

We have moved beyond subjective protocols and into data-driven enhancement. Where they sought to control, we seek to **evolve**. Where they relied on rare "naturals," we build **operators**.

Our Core Mission is built on three pillars of *verifiable* cognitive enhancement:

* **MULTIMODAL MEMORY ENHANCEMENT**
    Research-backed visual augmentation combined with auditory theta entrainment (4-8 Hz) for superior memory encoding.
* **THETA STATE OPTIMIZATION**
    A 47% increase in theta power demonstrated through EEG studies (η²=.304) using synchronized binaural beats and visual flicker—the optimal state for advanced PK-PSI tasking.
* **EVIDENCE-BASED LEARNING**
    Published research showing 21% improved recall (M=38.2 vs 31.5) with persistent 7-day retention advantages.

The old projects are history. ShadowFang is the evolution.
