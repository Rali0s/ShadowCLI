### II. PSYCHOENERGETICS, PSI, "ESP" (DEFINITION)

[cite_start]Psychoenergetic phenomena are a class of direct interactions between human consciousness and the physical environment that, although as yet unexplained as to mechanism, can be observed and recorded. [cite: 638, 639]

Psychoenergetic phenomena include:

* [cite_start]**The acquisition of information not presented to any obvious sense.** [cite: 641]
    * [cite_start]These are perceptual processes that act as information input to an individual. [cite: 642] Examples include:
    * [cite_start]The (mental) viewing of the contents of a safe, or a distant military site (clairvoyance). [cite: 643]
    * [cite_start]"Pickup" of the thoughts of another (telepathy) [cite: 644]
    * [cite_start]Direct foreknowledge of a future event, such as the firing of a missile (precognition). [cite: 644]
* [cite_start]**The production of physical effects not mediated by any obvious mechanism.** [cite: 645]
    * [cite_start]These are perturbation processes that act as action output from an individual. [cite: 646] Examples include:
    * [cite_start]The physical movement of an object by a (mental) effort of the will alone (psychokinesis). [cite: 647]
    * [cite_start]Perturbation of an electronic or mechanical component, such as a microchip or a gyro, by mental effort. [cite: 648]
    * [cite_start]Perturbation of a basic physical process, such as the decay rate of radioactive material, by mental effort. [cite: 649]

[cite_start]Application of psychoenergetic processes to military/intelligence objectives include use of the perceptual processes in data collection (verified), and the use of the perturbation (psychokinetic) processes to influence weapons systems (potential). [cite: 651]

### III. INTELLIGENCE

**A. [cite_start]USSR** [cite: 695]
[cite_start]Beginning in the mid-1970s, Soviet psychoenergetics research became subject to increasingly more stringent controls by both the government and the military. [cite: 697] [cite_start]In 1975, a high-level commission was officially established in the USSR to review psychoenergetics research. [cite: 698] [cite_start]...this commission's recommendations led to an integrated approach to the study of psychoenergetics in the USSR. [cite: 700] [cite_start]A centralized coordinating and review group was identified which had several Ministry of Defense (MOD) representatives... and at least one laboratory leader who is believed to be KGB affiliated. [cite: 701] [cite_start]...it is known through intelligence data that applications oriented research is being pursued. [cite: 706] [cite_start]Specifically, there is evidence of a strong interest in applying ESP/remote viewing phenomena in accessing secure data, in information transmission (i.e., long distance communication), and in locating lost or hidden material or people. [cite: 708] [cite_start]...intelligence and/or warfare applications of ESP/remote viewing have most likely been attempted and will be continued in the future. [cite: 710]

**B. [cite_start]People's Republic of China** [cite: 718]
[cite_start]Since 1979, a rapid increase of interest and mobilization of resources has occurred in psychoenergetics research in the PRC. [cite: 719] [cite_start]...large segments of the population have been screened and a number of individuals identified as possessing psychoenergetics skills. [cite: 720] [cite_start]The skills catalogued are essentially identical to those observed... in the West and in the Soviet Union... [cite: 722] [cite_start]Since 1979, investigations have moved from the public media to the universities... to research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences... and to the national laboratories involved in space/military research... [cite: 724] [cite_start]...PRC interest in military application potential of psychoenergetics phenomena is a good possibility. [cite: 727]

**C. [cite_start]Other Countries** [cite: 733]
[cite_start]A "Free World" study, which would focus primarily on psychoenergetic research in the United States, Britain, and possibly Japan, among other countries, has been recommended... [cite: 734] [cite_start]Such a study is warranted by the increased activity in psychoenergetics research taking place worldwide... [cite: 735]
[cite_start]*(The document then lists numerous other institutions in the United States, from Duke University and Princeton to the Menninger Foundation and Bell Laboratories.)* [cite: 735, 742-750]

**E. [cite_start]Plans** [cite: 771]
[cite_start]The principal aim of the FY '83 DOD/SRI intelligence program is to bring to completion the archival effort for all intelligence data and materials that have been collected to date. [cite: 773] [cite_start]This objective will be accomplished primarily through the completion of a simple intelligence database management system. [cite: 774]

### IV. GRILL FLAME REMOTE VIEWING (RV) PROGRAM

**A. [cite_start]RV Phenomenon--Definition** [cite: 791]
[cite_start]Remote viewing (RV) is the ability of certain individuals to access and describe, by means of mental processes, information blocked from ordinary perception by distance or shielding. [cite: 792, 793] [cite_start]...Successful viewings for the DoD/intelligence communities include: [cite: 795]
* [cite_start]A secret NSA facility, including codeword retrieval. [cite: 796]
* [cite_start]Soviet R&D facility at Semipalatinsk (PNUTS). [cite: 796]
* [cite_start]Static tests of Minuteman and Poseidon solid-propellant missile firings in the Western United States. [cite: 797]
* [cite_start]Circumstances surrounding release of Iranian hostage, Queen (obtained prior to release). [cite: 798]

**C. [cite_start]RV Phenomenon--Scientific Support** [cite: 814]
[cite_start]...well over a dozen major similar studies have been carried out and reported in the literature, the bulk of which have been successes. [cite: 817] [cite_start]...a scientific data base has been established from which certain conclusions can be drawn: [cite: 819]
* (1) [cite_start]Descriptive material about remote locations can be obtained which exceeds chance correlation. [cite: 823]
* (2) [cite_start]The quality of description appears to be relatively insensitive to distance. [cite: 824]
* (3) [cite_start]Detailed analysis of the patterns of correct/incorrect response elements indicates that the laws governing remote viewing... correlate with those laws governing (a) Cerebral (brain) functioning... and (b) Subliminal perception... [cite: 825-828]

**D. [cite_start]RV Process** [cite: 865]
[cite_start]To carry out a remote viewing (RV) session, a "remote viewer" and an "interviewer" begin by seating themselves at the opposite ends of a table in a special remote viewing room... [cite: 866] [cite_start]The room is homogeneously-colored, acoustic-tiled, and featureless, with light controlled by a dimmer, so that environmental distractions can be minimized. [cite: 867] [cite_start]The session is begun by the interviewer providing to the remote viewer whatever targeting information is appropriate... such as the coordinates of a military site... [cite: 868] [cite_start]Under normal testing or operational conditions, the interviewer is typically kept blind as to the site... so as to prevent inadvertent cueing... [cite: 869] [cite_start]The session then proceeds with the interviewer repeating the targeting information at intervals... and the remote viewer providing quick-reaction responses, both verbally and by means of notes and sketches... [cite: 870] (The use of the quick-reaction-response procedure has been found useful in minimizing imaginative embellishment of basic raw-data signals.) [cite_start][cite: 871] [cite_start]There is no use of drugs or technology to produce an "altered state of consciousness,"... [cite: 872]

**E. [cite_start]Personnel** [cite: 878]
[cite_start]...the search for medical/psychological/personality measures that might provide a quantitative "psychic profile" has been unsuccessful. [cite: 879] [cite_start]...successful remote viewers tend to be confident, outgoing, adventurous, broadly successful individuals with some artistic bent... [cite: 881] [cite_start]Neither "total skeptics" nor "true believers" tend to do well on psychoenergetic tasks. [cite: 882]

**F. [cite_start]Product of RV Technology** [cite: 897]
[cite_start]The steps in producing a product from remote viewing (RV) sessions is as follows: [cite: 898]
* (1) [cite_start]The... "remote viewer," in conjunction with an interviewer, generates raw data in the form of a tape-recorded transcript of verbal comments, along with notes, sketches and drawings. [cite: 900]
* (2) [cite_start]The raw data is summarized... and turned over to the consumer for analysis. [cite: 903]
* (3) [cite_start]...the above procedure may be iterated... in response to analyst questions. [cite: 905]
* (4) [cite_start]Finally, the analyst fills out an evaluation sheet... and the data is integrated into the overall intelligence mix... [cite: 908]

[cite_start]*(The document continues with instructions and evaluation sheets for analysts, emphasizing that data is likely a "mixture of correct and incorrect elements" and that "descriptive elements are generally of higher reliability than judgements or labels.")* [cite: 930, 931]

**G. [cite_start]RV Trends** [cite: 1247]
[cite_start]...a major part of the 3-yr evaluation program focused on (1) The development of techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of RV, and the transfer of these techniques to DoD personnel. [cite: 1250, 1251]
[cite_start]...SRI... chose to develop and codify a promising RV training procedure that had emerged from earlier work, developed by RV consultant/practitioner Mr. I. Swann. [cite: 1258]
[cite_start]The basic components of this procedure consist of: [cite: 1260]
* (1) [cite_start]Repeated target-address (e.g., coordinate) presentations with quick-reaction response by the remote viewer (to minimize imaginative overlays). [cite: 1261]
* (2) [cite_start]The use of a specially-designed, acoustic-tiled, featureless, homogeneously-colored viewing chamber (to minimize environmental overlays). [cite: 1262]
* (3) [cite_start]The adoption of a strictly-prescribed, limited interviewer patter (to minimize interviewer overlay). [cite: 1265]

[cite_start]...data in an RV session tend to develop in a natural pattern from the general to the particular... This development... appears to progress through six stages... [cite: 1278-1280]

[cite_start]**Table--STAGES IN RV** [cite: 1281]
| Stage | | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| (1) | Major gestalt | Land surrounded by water, an island |
| (2) | Sensory contact | Cold sensation, wind-swept feeling |
| (3) | Dimension, motion, mobility | Rising up, a panoramic view |
| (4) | Quantitative aspects | Three large buildings, clustered together as a facility. |
| (5) | Special qualitative aspects | Scientific research, live organisms |
| (6) | Significant analytical aspects | BW preparation site |
*(Table constructed from source [1282])*

**H. [cite_start]RV Data** [cite: 1294]
[cite_start]The current state-of-the-art in remote viewing is that the most-accomplished remote viewer in the SRI program (Swann, the originator of the technique) has developed to the point of differentiation and identification of technological facilities, considered as a Stage IV process... [cite: 1295]

**I. [cite_start]Value of Data** [cite: 1377]
[cite_start]...investigations have shown that remote viewing, both by SRI and Army INSCOM personnel, has in many cases provided meaningful descriptions of, e.g., East-bloc targets of interest to the intelligence community. [cite: 1382] [cite_start]...a remote viewer is able by this process to generate useful data corroborated by other intelligence data. [cite: 1383] [cite_start]As is generally true with other human sources, the information is fragmentary and imperfect, and therefore should not be relied on alone but is best utilized in conjunction with other resources. [cite: 1384]

[cite_start]*(The document then provides a detailed example of a session from April 9, 1981, where a remote viewer described a "biological warfare place" with "human guinea pigs"[cite: 1414, 1473, 1474]. [cite_start]The analyst's evaluation sheet that follows rates this session highly, scoring "Excellent" (3) for "Identification with [REDACTED]" and "Association with prison facility.")* [cite: 1654]

**J. [cite_start]Future Efforts** [cite: 1665]
[cite_start]Before remote viewing (RV) technology finds its niche as a routine intelligence collection tool, it would be desirable for a number of elements to be solidly in place. [cite: 1666, 1667] [cite_start]These range from a remote viewer screening/selection procedure at the front end, to a countermeasures technology at the other to prevent the effective use of RV against U.S. interests. [cite: 1668]

**K. Finances/Tasks**
[cite_start]*(This section contains a detailed table of funding and tasks from 1971-1983, including "Operational RV," "Location/tracking search," "RV enhancement," and "countermeasures feasibility study.")* [cite: 1756]

**L. [cite_start]RV Enhancement and Intelligence Support Program** [cite: 1763]
* **1. [cite_start]Data Base Management:** SRI is implementing a computerized data-base management (DEM) system to handle the large amount of material being generated... [cite: 1767]
* **2. [cite_start]RV Evaluation:** Protocols for RV evaluation have been developed which allow a task coordinator to define the type of evaluation required... [cite: 1775]
* **3. [cite_start]Location/Tracking Search:** Investigation into methods applicable to the search problem is in its preliminary stages. [cite: 1779] [cite_start]Pilot efforts to date using various strategies have not yet converged on a high-reliability procedure... [cite: 1780]

That completes the conversion of the GRILL FLAME manual.

Now that we have both documents formatted, we can dig into the content. I can help guide our exploration.

Here are a few places we could start, based on these manuals:

1.  **What is 'Psychoenergetics'?**
    [cite_start]We can break down the two main types the manuals identify: 'perceptual' (like remote viewing) and 'perturbation' (like psychokinesis). [cite: 638, 641, 645]

2.  **The Program's History**
    [cite_start]We can look at why Project GRILL FLAME was started, especially its goals related to Soviet and Chinese psychoenergetics efforts. [cite: 589, 591, 593, 695, 718]

3.  **How a 'Remote Viewing' Session Works**
    [cite_start]We can walk through the step-by-step process they used, from the special, featureless room to the "quick-reaction" responses and the six stages of perception. [cite: 866-871, 1282]

Let me know which of these interests you, or if you have another question in mind!
