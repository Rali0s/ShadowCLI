# Frequency-Based Neuro-Programming for Memory & Cognition Enhancement

*A Revised Experimental Framework with Schema Design, Frequency
Entrainment, and Historical Context*

## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive research and experimental framework
for memory and cognition enhancement using frequency-based entrainment
as an ethical, replicable alternative to historical pharmacological
methods...

## Clinical Glossary of Terms

**Anchor** -- A sensory stimulus (auditory, visual, tactile) paired with
a schema for triggering. **Affirmation** -- Short verbal phrase
reinforcing schema during entrainment. **Alpha Waves (8--12 Hz)** -- EEG

alert attention, active recall. **Visualization** -- Mental imagery
practice for schema creation.
